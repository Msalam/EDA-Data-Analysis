## 🚀 Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing with **Pandas**
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Plotting histograms, scatter plots, pairplots, and boxplots
- Statistical analysis:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Standard Deviation, Variance
  - Correlation between features
- Example visualizations:
  - Sales distribution
  - Car performance (mpg, hp, weight, etc.)
  - Category-based analysis
